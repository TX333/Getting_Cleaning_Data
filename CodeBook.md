## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project Codebook

### Introduction
The r_analysis script performs the tasks listed in the Getting and Cleaning Data course project as listed in the readme.md file.

The data is comes from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset which utilized the accelerometer and gyro tools within smartphones to measure movement of 30 participants in 6 different activities.  There were over 10,000 measurements initially split between a test set and a training set.  The objective was to combine the test and training data sets along with information on the activities, measurements, and participants to build a single data set that would summarize the means and standard deviations for each activity and participant.
### Variables
From the 561 total variables, we selected 73 measuring only the means and standard deviations.
The activities measured were:
 <li>- Walking
 - Standing
 - Laying
 - Sitting
 - Walking Upstairs
 - Walking Downstairs
